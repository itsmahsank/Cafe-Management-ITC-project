# Cafe-Management-ITC-project
This C++ project is a Cafe Management System with a menu-driven interface. It allows users to manage student records by viewing, inserting, altering, and deleting them. The system uses basic input/output operations, loops, and conditionals to handle tasks efficiently, providing an organized way to manage student data in a simulated environment.
